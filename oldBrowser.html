<p>I'm sorry, but your browser, Internet Explorer 8 or 7 (or maybe even 6), is not yet supported by #edpain. We understand this is itself an #edpain, but with limited time and resources we can only do so much; something we are sure you understand intimately.</p>
<p>Please download a more modern browser such as <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>. If you can't, email me at edpain@digitalharborfoundation.org and I'll submit an #edpain for you.</p>
